# Introducing the Grid View Widget

The GridView displays a two-dimensional array of widgets. Now, in our GridView demo, we're going to be using many images, so the images sub-folder inside my Flutter Project has a number of images that have placed in there, make sure that your pubspec.yaml file has an assets specification and point to your images sub-folder, Now, in this GridView demo, I'm going to do something a little different. I'm going to have my main widget within the main.dart file. This is the MyStore StatelessWidget. This MyStore StatelessWidget displays a list of products. I set the body of the scaffold to the ProductsView.But I'm going to define this ProductsView in a separate file. So, open up the left navigation pane and create a new sub-folder within the lib folder that contains the main.dart file.

I'm going to name this New Directory that I create views because this directory that I'm about to create will hold the views that I display in my app. So, I have the views directory under the lib sub-folder and under the views directory, I'm going to create a New Dart File called products.dart. This products.dart file is what will contain the widget products view which will display a GridView of products. Now, all changes that I make to my app will be to this products.dart file. I won't be changing main.dart at all. Now, in order to be able to reference this class in the main.dart file, I need to add in an import statement. Let's head back to products.dart and see how we can set up a GridView to display products. Now, the main axis of the GridView is the direction in which the GridView scrolls, which is vertical by default. I've set the crossAxisCount to be 2 to indicate that I want to display 2 grids per row. The children property of the GridView are all containers. Every container has a slightly different background and has a text field as a child which displays different product categories. For example, this first GridItem displays the product Breakfast and Dairy. And if, we scroll down,

the second GridItem displays Fresh Vegetables, this is on line 23, and so on. I've just hardcoded a whole number of containers here that make up the different widgets displayed within my GridView. You can use the crossAxisCount to control how many grid elements you want to see in a particular grid row.
